# Feed Reader Project

A simple application that reads RSS feeds and needs tests suites. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, he's already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing his first test suite! Unfortunately, he decided to move on to start his own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!
